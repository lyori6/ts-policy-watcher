    "initial_summary": "## TikTok Competitor Community Guidelines Summary\n\nThis document outlines a comprehensive set of community guidelines for a TikTok-like platform, effective May 17, 2024.  Key areas covered include:\n\n* **Content Moderation:**  The platform employs a three-pronged approach: removing violating content, restricting age-inappropriate content (for users under 18), and making ineligible for recommendation (For You feed) content that doesn't meet platform standards.\n\n* **Prohibited Content:**  A wide range of prohibited content is detailed, encompassing: violence, hate speech, sexual abuse, harassment, self-harm, dangerous activities, misinformation, scams, regulated goods (alcohol, firearms, etc.), and violations of privacy and security.  Specific examples are provided within each category, though the document notes that these are not exhaustive.\n\n* **Community Empowerment:** The platform provides users with tools and resources to manage their experience, including safety settings, filtering options, and reporting mechanisms.\n\n* **Enforcement:** While the specifics of enforcement aren't detailed, the document implies a combination of automated and human moderation to address policy violations.\n\nThe guidelines aim to create a safe and welcoming environment while balancing creative expression and the prevention of harm.  The full guidelines are categorized for easier navigation, with additional information and examples available for each section.\n",
    "last_update_summary": "## Trust & Safety Policy Update: TikTok Community Guidelines (New Policy)\n\n**To:** Product Manager\n**From:** Trust & Safety Analyst\n**Date:** [Current Date]\n**Subject:** Analysis of TikTok's New Community Guidelines (Effective May 17, 2024)\n\nThis diff represents the introduction of TikTok's latest Community Guidelines, released April 17, 2024, and effective May 17, 2024. Rather than minor changes, this appears to be a comprehensive refresh.\n\n### Key Takeaways for Product:\n\n1.  **Clearer Policy Structure:**\n    *   **Distinction between \"Rules\" and \"Standards\":** The policy explicitly differentiates \"rules\" (what's allowed on TikTok, subject to removal) from \"standards\" (what's eligible for the For You feed/FYF). This is a crucial clarification for content moderation and algorithmic promotion.\n    *   **Organized by Topic:** Guidelines are structured under clear categories (e.g., Youth Safety, Safety & Civility, Mental & Behavioral Health, Integrity & Authenticity, Regulated Goods, Privacy & Security).\n\n2.  **Tiered Content Moderation Approach:** TikTok now clearly outlines four safety approaches:\n    *   **Remove:** Content violating \"rules\" (public or private) will be removed.\n    *   **Restrict:** Content not suitable for youth will be restricted to users 18+.\n    *   **Make Ineligible for FYF:** Content not meeting \"recommendation standards\" will not be promoted on the For You feed.\n    *   **Empower:** Provide users with information, tools (labels, opt-in screens, warnings), and resources (safety toolkit, account controls, in-app features).\n\n3.  **Emphasis on Integrity and Authenticity:**\n    *   **AI-Generated Content (AIGC):** A new specific sub-category for \"Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC)\" is now present under \"Integrity and Authenticity,\" indicating an increased focus on this area.\n    *   **Other Areas:** Continued focus on Misinformation, Civic/Election Integrity, Fake Engagement, Unoriginal Content, Spam, and Deceptive Behavior.\n\n4.  **Detailed Section on \"Accounts and Features\":**\n    *   Includes specific rules/standards for **TikTok LIVE, Search, External Links, Comments & Direct Messages, and Monetization**, indicating dedicated policy considerations for these product areas.\n\n5.  **Enhanced Enforcement Transparency:**\n    *   Sections on \"Public Interest Exceptions,\" \"Detection and Reporting,\" and \"Notice and Appeals\" provide more clarity on their enforcement processes.\n\n**Overall:** This new policy reflects a more structured, explicit, and nuanced approach to content moderation, particularly with its tiered system and specific attention to emerging areas like AIGC. Product teams should review the relevant sections to ensure features and user flows align with these updated guidelines, especially regarding content visibility and algorithmic distribution (FYF eligibility).",

Repeat offenders may be prevented from accessing future policy trainings.  The policy applies to videos, comments, livestreams, and external links.\n",

This is not an incremental update but a complete re-articulation of their stance and enforcement.\n\n**Key Tenets & Prohibited Content:**\n\n1.  **Broad Definition:** Prohibits content that targets individuals with prolonged insults/slurs based on physical traits or protected group status, threats, and doxxing. Stricter enforcement applies to content targeting minors (under 18).\n2.  **Specific Prohibitions Highlighted:**\n    *   **Minors:** Content intended to shame, deceive, or insult minors (e.g., name-calling, tricking them).\n    *   **PII & Doxxing:** Sharing *any* non-public Personally Identifiable Information (PII) \u2013 including one's own, accidental sharing, or encouraging its sharing. Fake PII must be clearly indicated.\n    *   **Coordinated Abuse:** Encouraging \"brigading\" or coordinated abuse on/off platform.\n    *   **Harmful Conspiracy Theories:** Promoting or targeting individuals based on conspiracy theories linked to direct threats or violence.\n    *   **Threats:** Implicit or explicit threats to identifiable individuals or their property (e.g., brandishing weapons).\n    *   **Staged Misconduct:** Depicting staged meet-ups accusing egregious misconduct with minors without law enforcement.\n    *   **Vigilantism:** Content depicting vigilantes restraining, assaulting, or engaging in dangerous vehicle pursuits.\n    *   **Mocking & Simulation:** Reveling in/mocking death/serious injury of identifiable individuals, or realistically simulating deceased persons describing their death/violence.

Examples include debates involving high-profile officials, scripted satire/comedy/music, or harassment education/awareness. *Crucially, these are not a \"pass to harass,\" and insults based on protected group status are strictly handled regardless of public profile.*\n5.  **Monetization & Enforcement Penalties:**\n    *   Content removal for violations.\n    *   First violation typically results in a warning, with an option to complete policy training to expire the warning after 90 days.\n    *   Accumulation of 3 strikes within 90 days leads to channel termination.\n    *   Severe abuse or channels dedicated to policy violations may result in immediate termination. Repeat offenders may lose access to policy training.\n    *   Specific monetization penalties outlined for creators who repeatedly encourage abusive behavior, target individuals, expose to physical harm risks, or incite hostility for financial gain.\n\n**Key Changes (as this is a new file, the entire policy is new):**\n\nThis document establishes YouTube's current, comprehensive stance on harassment. Key areas that appear strengthened or explicitly codified include:\n\n*   **Explicit focus on minors:** A dedicated section and stricter approach for content targeting individuals under 18.\n*   **Expanded PII/Doxxing:** Clearer definition of PII and explicit prohibition of sharing *any* non-public PII, including one's own.\n*   **New Categories of Harm:** Introduction of policies against harmful conspiracy theories, vigilante actions, mocking death/injury, and various forms of simulated violence. This indicates an increased awareness of evolving online harms.\n*   **Refined Sexualization Policy:** Clearer definitions of unwanted sexualization, including NCII and fantasizing about sexual assault.\n*   **EDSA Clarifications:** Detailed exceptions for educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content, while maintaining a strict stance against using these as excuses for harassment.\n*   **Monetization Impact:** Explicitly linking severe or repeated harassment to potential demonetization or other penalties beyond standard strikes.\n\nThis policy reflects a significant effort to create a safer environment by addressing a wider array of harmful behaviors with more specific guidance and stricter enforcement.",

Certain content lacks optimal support and is therefore unsupported in Shopping ads, though this doesn't affect other Google platforms.\n\n**2. Prohibited Practices:** This section addresses abuse of the ad network (malicious content, unfair advantages, bypassing reviews), irresponsible data collection and use (insecure data handling), and misrepresentation (misleading promotions, inaccurate product portrayal).\n\n**3. Restricted Content:**  This category covers legally or culturally sensitive content allowed with limitations and potential additional requirements. Examples include adult-oriented content, alcoholic beverages, copyrighted material, gambling, healthcare products, political content, and High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) food & beverages (prohibited from targeting minors).\n\n**4.
