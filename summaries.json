The overarching principle is to \"lead by example, not by force,\" ensuring unbiased actions and compliance with Whatnot's Community Guidelines.\n*   **Moderator Expectations:**\n    *   Avoid abuse of power; only remove/report users if actions warrant it or if the seller requests.\n    *   **Do not ban users for mere disagreement or opinions.**\n    *   Maintain an unbiased stance to keep communities safe.\n    *   Primary responsibility in chat is to ensure content standards and address offending users/spam.\n*   **Best Practices Emphasized:**\n    *   Treat all users with respect and without bias.\n    *   Engage with chat and answer user questions.\n    *   Delete inappropriate messages promptly.\n    *   **Crucially, \"Issue a verbal warning first and do not ban users without a valid cause.\"**\n*   **Moderator Privileges:**\n    *   **Remove Users From Show:** Removes a user *only from the current livestream*.

The emphasis on unbiased action, verbal warnings before bans, and the limited scope of the \"Remove from Show\" privilege suggests a focus on fostering community and maintaining a less punitive environment, while still empowering sellers with tools to manage their immediate livestream experience.

Certain content lacks optimal support and is therefore unsupported in Shopping ads, though this doesn't affect other Google platforms.\n\n**2. Prohibited Practices:** This section addresses abuse of the ad network (malicious content, unfair advantages, bypassing reviews), irresponsible data collection and use (insecure data handling), and misrepresentation (misleading promotions, inaccurate product portrayal).\n\n**3. Restricted Content:**  This category covers legally or culturally sensitive content allowed with limitations and potential additional requirements. Examples include adult-oriented content, alcoholic beverages, copyrighted material, gambling, healthcare products, political content, and High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) food & beverages (prohibited from targeting minors).\n\n**4. Editorial & Technical Requirements:**  Ads must meet high professional and editorial standards, be clear, and lead to relevant, user-friendly landing pages. Technical requirements ensure ad functionality across various formats.\n\n**Enforcement:** Google uses AI and human review to enforce policies, taking actions ranging from disapproving ads to suspending accounts for violations.  Advertisers can appeal decisions.  Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations is mandatory.\n",

    "initial_summary": "Here's a concise summary of the Twitch Privacy Notice for a Product Manager, from a Trust & Safety perspective:\n\n**Twitch Privacy Notice - Key Aspects for Product Management**\n\nThe Twitch Privacy Notice (Last modified: 06/30/2023) outlines data collection, use, and disclosure practices, emphasizing Twitch's role as a data controller and an Amazon subsidiary.\n\n*   **Data Collection & Public Nature:**\n    *   **Comprehensive Collection:** Gathers user-provided data (account info, billing, content like voice/image), automatically collected data (IP, device, usage metrics via cookies), and data from linked third-party services (social media, games) or live events (recordings, badge scans).\n    *   **Social & Public Activities:** Highlights that many Twitch Services are inherently public (broadcasting, chat, profile info), meaning user-provided data in these contexts is designed to be seen and potentially collected by others.\n\n*   **Data Use & Disclosure:**\n    *   **Core Functions & Security:** Data is used for operating, maintaining, securing services, managing accounts, personalizing content (including ads), and preventing fraud/abuse.\n    *   **Amazon & Affiliates:** Personal data is shared within Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries (under equivalent privacy standards) to operate, provide, and improve both Twitch and Amazon products/services.\n    *   **Service Providers & Legal Obligations:** Data is shared with service providers (hosting, analytics) under strict confidentiality. Twitch also reserves the right to disclose data to comply with legal requirements (e.g., court orders) or to protect Twitch, its users, or others from liability, fraud, or harm.\n    *   **No Sale of Data:** Explicitly states Twitch is \"not in the business of selling our users\u2019 personal information.\"\n\n*   **User Rights & Controls (Data Subject Rights):**\n    *   **Broad Rights:** Users are granted rights to access, update, delete, restrict processing, object to direct marketing, and revoke consent. Mechanisms are provided via account settings and support.\n    *   **Retention Post-Deletion:** Notes that Twitch may retain \"certain information\" post-account closure for legitimate interests or legal obligations.\n    *   **Identity Verification:** Twitch may verify identity before fulfilling data requests.\n\n*   **Third-Party Integrations & Accountability:**\n    *   **External Links:** Emphasizes that third-party websites/services linked from Twitch are *not* governed by this policy, requiring users to review external privacy policies.\n    *   **Linked Accounts:** Connecting Twitch to third-party services (e.g., Discord, Xbox) *explicitly authorizes Twitch to share specific data* (username, activity) with those third parties.\n    *   **Extensions & Applications:** Third-party Extension developers receive \"automatically collected information\" from viewer interaction, but Twitch requires explicit user \"Grant Access\" for username/ID. Users are responsible for data provided directly to developers. Developers are contractually required to process data only for defined purposes, but users are encouraged to review the developer's privacy policy.\n    *   **Live Event Exhibitors:** Allowing exhibitors to scan badges explicitly transfers personal information to them, after which *their* privacy policy applies.\n\n**Key Trust & Safety Considerations for PMs:**\n\n1.  **Transparency & Consent:** Ensure product features clearly communicate when user data (especially public data or data shared via integrations) is being collected or shared, and obtain appropriate consent.\n2.  **Third-Party Risk:** Be acutely aware that integrating with third-party services, extensions, or allowing in-person badge scans shifts data responsibility to the third party, requiring clear user disclosure and strong developer/partner agreements.\n3.  **Data Subject Rights:** Design features and data flows with robust processes to easily accommodate user requests for access, modification, and deletion of their data in compliance with global privacy laws.\n4.  **Fraud & Abuse Prevention:** Understand that data collection and disclosure powers are explicitly used for security, fraud, and abuse prevention, supporting Trust & Safety operations.\n5.  **Data Retention:** Consider the implications of data retention policies, particularly for deleted accounts, and ensure legal and legitimate interest justifications are documented.",

Key T&S aspects include:\n\n*   **User Responsibility & Account Security:** Users are fully responsible for account security, all purchases made under their account, and maintaining accurate billing information. Purchases by minors (13-legal majority) require parental consent.\n*   **Payment & Fraud Prevention:**\n    *   Users authorize charges and accept that payment partners may require **Know Your Customer (KYC)** data (e.g., ID, address) for compliance.\n    *   Twitch can suspend/cancel orders or terminate accounts for payment failures, chargebacks, or suspected fraudulent activity.\n    *   \"Spendable Balance\" (for streamers) can be revoked if obtained or used fraudulently or in violation of terms.\n*   **Digital Content (Bits, Tokens, Rewards) - **_Critical Area_**:\n    *   **No Monetary Value & Non-Transferable:** Digital Content *has no monetary value*, is *not cash or property*, *cannot be sold, traded, or transferred* (including to other users), and *cannot be exchanged for cash or external goods/services*. This prohibits secondary markets and mitigates virtual currency regulatory risks.\n    *   **Non-Refundable & Forfeitable:** Generally non-refundable. Twitch retains full ownership and can unilaterally modify, suspend, or *terminate* Digital Content offerings at any time without compensation, meaning users have **no property rights and bear full risk of forfeiture**.\n    *   Use is subject to the **Bits Acceptable Use Policy**.\n*   **Policy Enforcement & Modifications:** Twitch reserves the right to refuse/cancel orders, terminate accounts in its sole discretion, and unilaterally modify these terms. For active recurring subscriptions, reasonable prior notice is given (with specific consent mechanisms for EU/UK/CH consumers).",

Product managers should confirm this aligns with the broader localization strategy for legal documents and that appropriate versions remain available for all target locales.",

    "initial_summary": "Here's a concise summary of the Twitch Terms of Service, highlighting key aspects for a Product Manager from a Trust & Safety perspective:\n\n*   **Binding Agreement & Scope:** The ToS is a legally binding contract for all users (registered or not), incorporating the Community Guidelines and Terms of Sale as foundational policies for user behavior and content.\n*   **User Eligibility & Safety:**\n    *   Minors: Users must be at least 13 years old. Those 13 to the age of legal majority require parental/guardian supervision and agreement to the ToS.\n    *   Blocked Users: Services are not available to users previously removed by Twitch or legally prohibited from receiving them (e.g., due to export restrictions).\n*   **Account Security & Responsibility:** Users are solely responsible for their account security and information accuracy. Selling, renting, or transferring accounts is prohibited, and users are liable for all activity under their account. Twitch reserves rights to combat unauthorized use.\n*   **User Content Ownership & Licensing:**\n    *   **Broad License Grant:** Users grant Twitch an unrestricted, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, and royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, display, and monetize their User Content.\n    *   **User Warranties:** Users are solely responsible for their content and must warrant they have the necessary rights, and that content does not infringe third-party IP, defame, or contain malicious code.\n    *   **Content Security Disclaimer (Critical):** Twitch uses \"reasonable security measures\" for User Content but **explicitly disclaims guarantees against unauthorized copying, use, or distribution by third parties.** Users agree Twitch is not liable for such events and waive claims. This represents a significant risk transfer to the user regarding content security.\n*   **Platform IP & User License:** Twitch retains ownership of its platform IP. Users are granted a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the services for personal or internal business use only, with strict prohibitions on commercial resale, distribution, or data mining.\n*   **Promotions:** Users running promotions on Twitch are **solely responsible** for ensuring legal compliance, administration, and all associated liabilities.",
