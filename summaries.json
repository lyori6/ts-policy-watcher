Key areas covered include:\n\n* **Content Moderation:**  The platform employs a three-pronged approach: removing violating content, restricting age-inappropriate content (for users under 18), and making ineligible for recommendation (For You feed) content that doesn't meet platform standards.\n\n* **Prohibited Content:**  A wide range of prohibited content is detailed, encompassing: violence, hate speech, sexual abuse, harassment, self-harm, dangerous activities, misinformation, scams, regulated goods (alcohol, firearms, etc.), and violations of privacy and security.  Specific examples are provided within each category, though the document notes that these are not exhaustive.\n\n* **Community Empowerment:** The platform provides users with tools and resources to manage their experience, including safety settings, filtering options, and reporting mechanisms.\n\n* **Enforcement:** While the specifics of enforcement aren't detailed, the document implies a combination of automated and human moderation to address policy violations.\n\nThe guidelines aim to create a safe and welcoming environment while balancing creative expression and the prevention of harm.
