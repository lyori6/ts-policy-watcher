Key areas covered include:\n\n* **Content Moderation:**  The platform employs a three-pronged approach: removing violating content, restricting age-inappropriate content (for users under 18), and making ineligible for recommendation (For You feed) content that doesn't meet platform standards.\n\n* **Prohibited Content:**  A wide range of prohibited content is detailed, encompassing: violence, hate speech, sexual abuse, harassment, self-harm, dangerous activities, misinformation, scams, regulated goods (alcohol, firearms, etc.), and violations of privacy and security.  Specific examples are provided within each category, though the document notes that these are not exhaustive.\n\n* **Community Empowerment:** The platform provides users with tools and resources to manage their experience, including safety settings, filtering options, and reporting mechanisms.\n\n* **Enforcement:** While the specifics of enforcement aren't detailed, the document implies a combination of automated and human moderation to address policy violations.\n\nThe guidelines aim to create a safe and welcoming environment while balancing creative expression and the prevention of harm.  The full guidelines are categorized for easier navigation, with additional information and examples available for each section.\n",

It outlines their approach to fostering a safe, welcoming, and entertaining platform.\n\n**Key Highlights for Product Managers:**\n\n1.  **Dual Scope (Rules & Standards):** The guidelines clearly distinguish between \"rules\" (what's prohibited) and \"standards\" (what's eligible for the For You Feed, FYF). This indicates a nuanced approach where content may be allowed on the platform but not promoted widely.\n2.  **Four-Pillar Content Moderation:**\n    *   **Remove:** Content violating core rules (public or private).\n    *   **Restrict:** Content unsuitable for youth (18+ audience only).\n    *   **Make Ineligible for FYF:** Content not meeting recommendation standards.\n    *   **Empower:** Users with information, tools (e.g., safety toolkit, account controls), labels, opt-in screens, and warnings for context.\n3.  **Structured Policy Areas:** The guidelines are extensively categorized, covering critical safety and integrity domains:\n    *   **Safety & Civility:** Strong focus on violent/criminal behavior, hate speech, abuse (youth/adult), human trafficking, harassment, and bullying.\n    *   **Mental & Behavioral Health:** Addresses suicide/self-harm, disordered eating, and dangerous activities/challenges.\n    *   **Integrity & Authenticity:** Explicitly includes **Edited Media & AI-Generated Content (AIGC)**, misinformation, civic/election integrity, fake engagement, unoriginal content, and spam. This signals an increased focus on synthetic media and content authenticity.\n    *   **Regulated Goods & Commercial Activities:** Comprehensive coverage including gambling, alcohol/tobacco/drugs, firearms, and frauds/scams, alongside commercial disclosure.\n    *   **FYF Eligibility Standards:** A dedicated section highlights the importance of content meeting specific standards to be discoverable via the primary recommendation engine.\n4.  **Enforcement Transparency:** Sections on Public Interest Exceptions, Detection & Reporting, and Notice & Appeals provide insight into their enforcement processes, including mechanisms for user recourse.\n\n**Implication:** This robust and detailed framework emphasizes a multi-layered approach to content moderation beyond simple removal, incorporating age-gating, algorithmic demotion (FYF ineligibility), and user empowerment tools. The explicit mention of AIGC signifies proactive policy development in response to emerging content risks.",

This includes using slurs (unless used self-referentially and with clearly indicated positive intent), supporting hate groups, and displaying hateful symbols (with exceptions for historical context, like pre-1933 artifacts).

Prohibits intolerance, demeaning, dehumanizing, encouraging violence, mocking hate crimes, supporting hate groups, promoting harmful stereotypes.\n    *   **Specific Content Rules:** Detailed guidelines for sensitive items like:\n        *   **Racial Slurs:** Allowed only if clearly self-referential or positive in intent.\n        *   **Hateful Symbols:** Explicitly bans Nazi propaganda, Swastikas (with narrow historical exceptions), grotesque \"Black Americana\" depictions (e.g., Gollywog dolls), and any live/recorded photography of **blackface/yellowface/redface/brownface**.\n        *   **Confederate Battle Flag:** Permitted only on historically accurate miniatures/models, artistic depictions denouncing the flag/slavery, or non-hateful civil-war themed book/video game covers.\n\n*   **Expanded Off-Platform Enforcement:** A significant shift, the policy now states that Whatnot may take action based on:\n    *   Verifiable evidence of **off-platform coordination of harassment** intended to occur on Whatnot (e.g., encouraging social media followers to send hateful messages on the platform).\n    *   In rare instances, verifiable **off-platform hate or harassment** if it poses a significant threat to the health of the Whatnot community or individuals, considering severity and persistence.\n\n**Implication for Product:** This policy sets a very high standard for user conduct and content moderation, requiring robust detection mechanisms and potentially increased human review.

However, these exceptions do not excuse malicious harassment, especially based on protected group status.\n\n**Enforcement:** Violations result in content removal and email notification.  First-time offenders receive a warning with a policy training option.  Multiple violations or severe abuse can lead to strikes, channel suspension, or termination.  Repeat offenders may be prevented from accessing future policy trainings.  The policy applies to videos, comments, livestreams, and external links.\n",

It applies broadly across all content types and features a robust enforcement framework.\n\n### Summary for Product Manager:\n\n**YouTube has launched a detailed and stricter Harassment & Cyberbullying policy** emphasizing the safety of creators, viewers, and partners, with a particular focus on protecting minors.\n\n**Key Prohibited Behaviors:**\n\n*   **Targeted Insults & Slurs:** Prolonged insults or slurs based on intrinsic attributes (physical traits, protected group status), or status as a survivor of sexual assault, NCII, domestic/child abuse.\n*   **Targeting Minors:** Content uploaded with the intent to shame, deceive, or insult individuals under 18.\n*   **Doxxing & PII Sharing:** Sharing, threatening to share, or encouraging sharing of non-public Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n*   **Threats & Violence:** Implicit or explicit threats against identifiable individuals or their property, including content simulating violence against others, depicting staged misconduct with minors (without law enforcement), or vigilante actions.\n*   **Harmful Conduct:**\n    *   Encouraging abusive behavior (e.g., brigading).\n    *   Promoting or targeting individuals with harmful conspiracy theories.\n    *   Reveling in/mocking death/serious injury of identifiable individuals.\n    *   Simulating deceased individuals describing their death/violence.\n    *   Stalking, denying/minimizing victim roles in major violent events.\n    *   Unwanted sexualization (lewd descriptions, NCII distribution/requests).\n    *   \"Swatting\" or encouraging emergency service pranks/harassment.\n    *   Video game content modified to promote violence against individuals.\n\n**Scope of Application:** The policy applies to all YouTube content formats, including videos, descriptions, comments, live streams, and external links.\n\n**Limited Exceptions:** Content may be allowed if its primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic (EDSA), such as debates on high-profile officials, scripted satire, or harassment awareness content. However, these are *not* a loophole for harassment, and there's a harder line on content targeting protected groups regardless of an individual's public profile.\n\n**Enforcement & Penalties:**\n\n*   Content that violates the policy will be removed.\n*   First-time violations typically result in a warning, with an option to take a policy training to expire the warning after 90 days.\n*   Repeated violations lead to strikes (3 strikes in 90 days result in channel termination).\n*   Channels may be terminated for severe abuse or if dedicated to policy violations.\n*   Monetization may be impacted for creators who repeatedly encourage abusive behavior, persistently target individuals based on intrinsic attributes, expose individuals to physical harm risks, or incite hostility for financial gain.",
