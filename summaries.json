    "initial_summary": "Here's a summary of YouTube's policy on hiding users for a product manager:\n\n*   **Moderation Capability:** Channel owners can hide specific users, preventing their comments from appearing on the channel (including past comments within 48 hours) and blocking them from creating clips from videos or live streams.\n*   **Management & Privacy:** Users are not notified when they are hidden. Creators can manage hidden users via direct comment interaction or through a centralized \"Hidden users\" list in YouTube Studio.\n*   **Unhide Behavior:** Unhiding a user restores their ability to comment on future content, but their previously hidden comments remain concealed.",
