Key features include:\n\n* **Creator Controls:** Creators can add moderators, control audience age (18+), filter comments, block keywords, mute, and block viewers directly from the LIVE settings or chat.  This applies to both mobile app and web browser access (via LIVE Studio or OBS Studio for broadcasting; not required for moderation).\n\n* **Moderator Permissions:** Moderators, granted permission by the creator, can mute, block viewers, and report comments violating Community Guidelines.  The level of control a moderator has is determined by the creator.\n\n* **User Actions:**  Viewers can be reported, muted (temporarily), or blocked (preventing future LIVE viewership and other interactions with the creator).  Notifications are sent to muted/blocked users.\n\n* **Accessibility:** Moderation tools are accessible both within the LIVE settings and directly from the LIVE chat interface on both the mobile app and web browser.\n",
