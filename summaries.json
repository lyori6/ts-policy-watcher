Key areas covered include:\n\n* **Content Moderation:**  The platform employs a three-pronged approach: removing violating content, restricting age-inappropriate content (for users under 18), and making ineligible for recommendation (For You feed) content that doesn't meet platform standards.\n\n* **Prohibited Content:**  A wide range of prohibited content is detailed, encompassing: violence, hate speech, sexual abuse, harassment, self-harm, dangerous activities, misinformation, scams, regulated goods (alcohol, firearms, etc.), and violations of privacy and security.  Specific examples are provided within each category, though the document notes that these are not exhaustive.\n\n* **Community Empowerment:** The platform provides users with tools and resources to manage their experience, including safety settings, filtering options, and reporting mechanisms.\n\n* **Enforcement:** While the specifics of enforcement aren't detailed, the document implies a combination of automated and human moderation to address policy violations.\n\nThe guidelines aim to create a safe and welcoming environment while balancing creative expression and the prevention of harm.

This applies to both mobile app and web browser access (via LIVE Studio or OBS Studio for broadcasting; not required for moderation).\n\n* **Moderator Permissions:** Moderators, granted permission by the creator, can mute, block viewers, and report comments violating Community Guidelines.  The level of control a moderator has is determined by the creator.\n\n* **User Actions:**  Viewers can be reported, muted (temporarily), or blocked (preventing future LIVE viewership and other interactions with the creator).  Notifications are sent to muted/blocked users.\n\n* **Accessibility:** Moderation tools are accessible both within the LIVE settings and directly from the LIVE chat interface on both the mobile app and web browser.\n",

The logo change is purely aesthetic.",

The overarching principle is to \"lead by example, not by force,\" ensuring unbiased actions and compliance with Whatnot's Community Guidelines.\n*   **Moderator Expectations:**\n    *   Avoid abuse of power; only remove/report users if actions warrant it or if the seller requests.\n    *   **Do not ban users for mere disagreement or opinions.**\n    *   Maintain an unbiased stance to keep communities safe.\n    *   Primary responsibility in chat is to ensure content standards and address offending users/spam.\n*   **Best Practices Emphasized:**\n    *   Treat all users with respect and without bias.\n    *   Engage with chat and answer user questions.\n    *   Delete inappropriate messages promptly.\n    *   **Crucially, \"Issue a verbal warning first and do not ban users without a valid cause.\"**\n*   **Moderator Privileges:**\n    *   **Remove Users From Show:** Removes a user *only from the current livestream*.

The emphasis on unbiased action, verbal warnings before bans, and the limited scope of the \"Remove from Show\" privilege suggests a focus on fostering community and maintaining a less punitive environment, while still empowering sellers with tools to manage their immediate livestream experience.

Certain content lacks optimal support and is therefore unsupported in Shopping ads, though this doesn't affect other Google platforms.\n\n**2. Prohibited Practices:** This section addresses abuse of the ad network (malicious content, unfair advantages, bypassing reviews), irresponsible data collection and use (insecure data handling), and misrepresentation (misleading promotions, inaccurate product portrayal).\n\n**3. Restricted Content:**  This category covers legally or culturally sensitive content allowed with limitations and potential additional requirements. Examples include adult-oriented content, alcoholic beverages, copyrighted material, gambling, healthcare products, political content, and High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) food & beverages (prohibited from targeting minors).\n\n**4. Editorial & Technical Requirements:**  Ads must meet high professional and editorial standards, be clear, and lead to relevant, user-friendly landing pages. Technical requirements ensure ad functionality across various formats.\n\n**Enforcement:** Google uses AI and human review to enforce policies, taking actions ranging from disapproving ads to suspending accounts for violations.  Advertisers can appeal decisions.  Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations is mandatory.\n",

It suggests a strategic decision to maintain an English-only primary version for this agreement, potentially reducing translation overhead or ensuring a single source of truth for legal interpretation.\n*   **Legal Clarity:** All direct and indirect legal references within this agreement are now consistently in English, which simplifies cross-referencing and ensures legal consistency across linked policies.",

    "initial_summary": "Here's a concise summary of the Twitch Privacy Notice for a Product Manager, from a Trust & Safety perspective:\n\n**Twitch Privacy Notice - Key Aspects for Product Management**\n\nThe Twitch Privacy Notice (Last modified: 06/30/2023) outlines data collection, use, and disclosure practices, emphasizing Twitch's role as a data controller and an Amazon subsidiary.\n\n*   **Data Collection & Public Nature:**\n    *   **Comprehensive Collection:** Gathers user-provided data (account info, billing, content like voice/image), automatically collected data (IP, device, usage metrics via cookies), and data from linked third-party services (social media, games) or live events (recordings, badge scans).\n    *   **Social & Public Activities:** Highlights that many Twitch Services are inherently public (broadcasting, chat, profile info), meaning user-provided data in these contexts is designed to be seen and potentially collected by others.\n\n*   **Data Use & Disclosure:**\n    *   **Core Functions & Security:** Data is used for operating, maintaining, securing services, managing accounts, personalizing content (including ads), and preventing fraud/abuse.\n    *   **Amazon & Affiliates:** Personal data is shared within Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries (under equivalent privacy standards) to operate, provide, and improve both Twitch and Amazon products/services.\n    *   **Service Providers & Legal Obligations:** Data is shared with service providers (hosting, analytics) under strict confidentiality. Twitch also reserves the right to disclose data to comply with legal requirements (e.g., court orders) or to protect Twitch, its users, or others from liability, fraud, or harm.\n    *   **No Sale of Data:** Explicitly states Twitch is \"not in the business of selling our users\u2019 personal information.\"\n\n*   **User Rights & Controls (Data Subject Rights):**\n    *   **Broad Rights:** Users are granted rights to access, update, delete, restrict processing, object to direct marketing, and revoke consent. Mechanisms are provided via account settings and support.\n    *   **Retention Post-Deletion:** Notes that Twitch may retain \"certain information\" post-account closure for legitimate interests or legal obligations.\n    *   **Identity Verification:** Twitch may verify identity before fulfilling data requests.\n\n*   **Third-Party Integrations & Accountability:**\n    *   **External Links:** Emphasizes that third-party websites/services linked from Twitch are *not* governed by this policy, requiring users to review external privacy policies.\n    *   **Linked Accounts:** Connecting Twitch to third-party services (e.g., Discord, Xbox) *explicitly authorizes Twitch to share specific data* (username, activity) with those third parties.\n    *   **Extensions & Applications:** Third-party Extension developers receive \"automatically collected information\" from viewer interaction, but Twitch requires explicit user \"Grant Access\" for username/ID. Users are responsible for data provided directly to developers. Developers are contractually required to process data only for defined purposes, but users are encouraged to review the developer's privacy policy.\n    *   **Live Event Exhibitors:** Allowing exhibitors to scan badges explicitly transfers personal information to them, after which *their* privacy policy applies.\n\n**Key Trust & Safety Considerations for PMs:**\n\n1.  **Transparency & Consent:** Ensure product features clearly communicate when user data (especially public data or data shared via integrations) is being collected or shared, and obtain appropriate consent.\n2.  **Third-Party Risk:** Be acutely aware that integrating with third-party services, extensions, or allowing in-person badge scans shifts data responsibility to the third party, requiring clear user disclosure and strong developer/partner agreements.\n3.  **Data Subject Rights:** Design features and data flows with robust processes to easily accommodate user requests for access, modification, and deletion of their data in compliance with global privacy laws.\n4.  **Fraud & Abuse Prevention:** Understand that data collection and disclosure powers are explicitly used for security, fraud, and abuse prevention, supporting Trust & Safety operations.\n5.  **Data Retention:** Consider the implications of data retention policies, particularly for deleted accounts, and ensure legal and legitimate interest justifications are documented.",
    "last_update_summary": "**Summary:** The Twitch Privacy Notice (`/nl-nl/legal/privacy-notice/`) has been fully transitioned from Dutch to English.\n\n**Specific Changes:**\n*   All policy text, section titles, and internal navigation links (e.g., 'Terms of Service,' 'Privacy Choices') have been translated from Dutch to English.\n*   Search functionality, placeholder text ('Search legal docs'), and legal document links now point to `/en/` paths and display English labels.\n*   The 'Last modified on' date for the Privacy Notice has been updated to June 30, 2023.\n\n**Impact (Trust & Safety):**\n*   **Clarity & Consistency:** Enhances understanding and ensures legal consistency for English-speaking users.\n*   **Localization Strategy:** This change *replaces* the Dutch policy. Product needs to confirm the strategy for Dutch-speaking users to ensure they are still adequately served with policy information, especially if Dutch was previously a supported localized legal document. This could impact user experience and regional compliance for users accustomed to Dutch-language legal content.",

This prohibits secondary markets and mitigates virtual currency regulatory risks.\n    *   **Non-Refundable & Forfeitable:** Generally non-refundable.
