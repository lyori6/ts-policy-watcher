# T&S Policy Watcher: Snapshot Architecture Improvement

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Environment Detection
The system automatically detects your environment:
- **GitHub Actions** → `snapshots/production/` (automatic)
- **Local Development** → `snapshots/development/` (with `DEBUG_FETCH=1` or `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=1`)
- **Default** → `snapshots/production/` (backward compatibility)

### Essential Commands

```bash
# 📋 List available production policies
python scripts/sync_prod_snapshots.py --list

# 🔄 Sync all production data to development
python scripts/sync_prod_snapshots.py --all

# 🎯 Sync specific policies for testing
python scripts/sync_prod_snapshots.py --policies youtube-harassment-policy,tiktok-community-guidelines

# 🧪 Run in development mode (writes to snapshots/development/)
DEBUG_FETCH=1 python scripts/fetch.py

# 🚀 Run in production mode (writes to snapshots/production/)
python scripts/fetch.py

# ✅ Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/test_snapshot_architecture.py tests/test_integration_workflow.py -v
```

### Directory Structure
```
snapshots/
├── production/          # 🚀 GitHub Actions (Git tracked)
│   └── [20 policies]
└── development/         # 💻 Local dev (Git ignored)
    └── [synced policies]
```

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**The Problem:** Our policy monitoring system suffered from constant merge conflicts between GitHub Actions (production) and local development, both writing to the same `snapshots/` directory. This created a 30+ minute overhead per development session and blocked efficient iteration.

**The Solution:** We implemented environment-based snapshot separation that completely isolates production and development environments while maintaining backward compatibility and enabling production data sync for local testing.

**The Impact:** 
- ✅ **Zero merge conflicts** - Production and development now operate in separate directories
- ✅ **Seamless local development** - Test changes without affecting production data
- ✅ **Production data access** - Sync utility allows testing against real policy data
- ✅ **100% backward compatibility** - No changes to existing GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ **21/21 tests passing** - Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

## 🔧 What We Built

### Environment-Based Snapshot Separation

**Core Innovation:** Dynamic environment detection that routes snapshots to different directories based on execution context.

```python
def get_snapshot_base_directory():
    """Environment detection logic implemented in scripts/fetch.py:712"""
    if os.getenv('GITHUB_ACTIONS'):
        return Path("snapshots/production")      # GitHub Actions
    elif os.getenv('DEBUG_FETCH') or os.getenv('DEVELOPMENT_MODE'):
        return Path("snapshots/development")     # Local development
    else:
        return Path("snapshots/production")      # Backward compatibility
```

### New Directory Structure

```
snapshots/
├── production/              # 🚀 GitHub Actions only (tracked in Git)
│   ├── tiktok-community-guidelines/
│   ├── youtube-harassment-policy/
│   ├── instagram-community-guidelines/
│   └── [all 20 production policies...]
└── development/             # 💻 Local development only (Git ignored)
    ├── test-policies/
    ├── debug-snapshots/
    └── [development work...]
```

### Production Sync Utility

**Local Development Enhancement:** Developers can now pull production snapshots for testing without conflicts.

```bash
# Sync all production policies to development
python scripts/sync_prod_snapshots.py --all

# Sync specific policies
python scripts/sync_prod_snapshots.py --policies youtube-harassment-policy,tiktok-community-guidelines

# List available production policies
python scripts/sync_prod_snapshots.py --list
```

## 🚀 Business Impact & Benefits

### Developer Experience Transformation

**Before:** 
- 30+ minutes per session resolving merge conflicts
- Unable to test locally without production risk
- Constant rebase failures blocking development
- Team scaling impossible due to exponential conflicts

**After:**
- ✅ **Zero merge conflicts** - Complete environment isolation
- ✅ **Safe local testing** - Development can't affect production  
- ✅ **Clean deployments** - No unexpected conflicts during releases
- ✅ **Team scalability** - Multiple developers work conflict-free

### Production Stability Improvements

- **Zero risk local testing** - Development cannot corrupt production data
- **Predictable deployments** - No merge conflicts during GitHub Actions
- **Maintainable architecture** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Reduced repository size** - Development snapshots excluded from Git
