# Link Health Monitoring & Broken URL Detection System

**A comprehensive plan to eliminate silent monitoring failures and ensure 100% policy URL uptime**

---

## üö® Executive Summary

Our Trust & Safety policy monitoring system has a critical blind spot: broken URLs cause silent failures, potentially missing important competitor policy changes. This document outlines a systematic approach to detect, alert on, and automatically maintain policy URL health.

**Goal**: Transform from reactive broken link fixing to proactive monitoring health management.

---

## 1. Problem Statement & Current Risk Analysis

### 1.1 The Silent Failure Problem

**What Happened**: Meta Commerce Policies URL (`https://help.instagram.com/1627591227523036`) returned "This Page Isn't Available" but our system continued running without alerts.

**Impact**: 
- We were unknowingly not monitoring a key competitor policy
- No visibility into monitoring system health
- Discovered broken link only during manual audit
- Could miss critical competitor policy changes indefinitely

### 1.2 Current Risk Assessment

| **Risk Level** | **Scenario** | **Impact** | **Current Detection** |
|----------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| üî¥ **HIGH** | Silent 404s on policy URLs | Miss competitor changes | None - discovered manually |
| üü° **MEDIUM** | Network timeouts/SSL errors | Intermittent monitoring gaps | Logged but not alerted |
| üü¢ **LOW** | Temporary site maintenance | Brief monitoring pause | Retry logic exists |

### 1.3 Scale of the Problem

- **Current monitoring**: 25+ policy URLs across 4 platforms
- **Manual maintenance**: No systematic health checking
- **Discovery method**: Accidental (during unrelated work)
- **Mean time to detection**: Unknown (could be weeks/months)

---

## 2. Current System Deep Audit

### 2.1 fetch.py Error Handling Analysis

**Current Behavior** (needs verification):
```python
# Likely current approach
response = await page.goto(policy['url'])
if response.status != 200:
    # What happens here? Log only? Skip? Fail silently?
```

**Questions to investigate**:
- How are HTTP 404/403/500 errors handled?
- Are network timeouts retried?
- Do failures get logged to run_log.json?
- Are persistent failures tracked across runs?

### 2.2 Notification System Gap Analysis

**Current Notifications**:
- ‚úÖ Policy content changes ‚Üí Email via Resend
- ‚ùå Broken URLs ‚Üí No notification
- ‚ùå System health issues ‚Üí No visibility  
- ‚ùå Persistent failures ‚Üí No tracking

**Notification Channels**:
- **Policy Changes**: Professional email summaries
- **System Health**: Missing entirely
- **Maintenance Alerts**: No system

### 2.3 Manual Link Maintenance

**Current Process**:
1. Broken link discovered accidentally
2. Manual research for replacement URL
3. Update `platform_urls.json`
4. No systematic validation

**Problems**:
- Reactive, not proactive
- No early warning system
- Scales poorly (25+ URLs, growing)
- Human error prone

## 3. Comprehensive Solution Architecture

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes & Foundation
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Goal**: Stop current bleeding, establish foundation

#### 3.1.1 Fix Meta Icon Display
- Investigate Font Awesome version compatibility
- Ensure `fab fa-meta` icon loads correctly
- Test across different Font Awesome CDN versions

#### 3.1.2 Enhanced Error Handling in fetch.py
```python
class PolicyFetchResult:
    success: bool
    url: str
    status_code: int
    error_type: str  # 'network', 'http_error', 'timeout', 'content_blocked'
    content: str
    retry_count: int
    timestamp: datetime
```

#### 3.1.3 Basic Broken Link Detection
- Classify HTTP responses: 200 (OK), 404 (broken), 403 (blocked), timeout
- Log all failures with classification
- Add failure tracking to run_log.json

### Phase 2: Proactive Health Monitoring System
**Timeline**: 3-5 days  
**Goal**: Systematic health checking independent of policy monitoring

#### 3.2.1 Daily Link Health Checks
```python
# New script: scripts/health_check.py
class LinkHealthChecker:
    async def check_all_urls(self):
        # Quick HEAD requests to all policy URLs
        # Separate from content fetching
        # Focus only on accessibility
    
    async def classify_failures(self):
        # 404: Broken link (immediate alert)
        # 403: Access blocked (investigate)
        # Timeout: Network issue (retry logic)
        # 5xx: Server error (temporary?)
```

#### 3.2.2 Multi-Channel Notification System
- **Policy Changes**: Existing email system (unchanged)
- **System Health**: New Slack/email channel for broken links
- **Dashboard Integration**: Visual health status indicators

#### 3.2.3 Health Status Dashboard
- Real-time URL accessibility status
- Historical uptime per policy URL
- Last successful check timestamps
- Failure pattern analysis

### Phase 3: Automated Maintenance Workflows  
**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Goal**: Self-healing and automated URL maintenance

#### 3.3.1 Smart URL Replacement Discovery
```python
class URLMaintenance:
    async def find_replacement_url(self, broken_url, policy_name, platform):
        # Try common URL pattern variations
        # Search platform help centers
        # Use Archive.org for historical URLs
        # Return suggested replacements
```

#### 3.3.2 Automated Retry & Recovery
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Alternative URL attempts for same policy
- Graceful degradation when primary URL fails

#### 3.3.3 Self-Healing Capabilities
- Try alternative URLs for same policy content
- Archive.org fallback for temporary outages  
- Automated policy URL research workflows

### Phase 4: Operational Excellence
**Timeline**: 7-10 days
**Goal**: Zero-maintenance health monitoring

#### 3.4.1 Comprehensive Monitoring Dashboard
- Policy monitoring uptime (target: 99.5%+)
- URL health trends and patterns
- Alert fatigue prevention (smart grouping)
- Maintenance task automation

#### 3.4.2 Automated Maintenance Workflows
- Weekly comprehensive URL audits
- Quarterly policy URL freshness reviews
- Integration with competitive research workflows
- Automated documentation updates

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### 4.1 Error Classification System

```python
class URLHealthStatus:
    HEALTHY = "healthy"           # 200 OK
    DEGRADED = "degraded"         # Slow but working
    BROKEN = "broken"             # 404, dead link
    BLOCKED = "blocked"           # 403, access denied  
    MAINTENANCE = "maintenance"   # 5xx, temporary
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"          # Network timeout, DNS
```

### 4.2 Enhanced Logging Schema

```json
{
  "url_health_check": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-07T10:30:00Z",
    "url": "https://example.com/policy",
    "status": "broken",
    "status_code": 404,
    "response_time_ms": 1250,
    "retry_count": 3,
    "error_details": "Page not found",
    "suggested_alternatives": ["https://example.com/new-policy"]
  }
}
```

### 4.3 Notification Templates

#### System Health Alert
```
üö® Policy Monitoring Alert

BROKEN LINK DETECTED:
‚Ä¢ Platform: Meta
‚Ä¢ Policy: Commerce Policies  
‚Ä¢ URL: https://help.instagram.com/1627591227523036
‚Ä¢ Error: 404 Not Found
‚Ä¢ Duration: 2 days
‚Ä¢ Impact: Missing competitor commerce policy monitoring

SUGGESTED ACTION:
‚Ä¢ Research replacement URL for Meta commerce policies
‚Ä¢ Update platform_urls.json with working link
‚Ä¢ Verify new URL accessibility

Dashboard: https://ts-policy-watcher.vercel.app/health
```

### 4.4 Self-Healing URL Discovery

```python
async def discover_replacement_url(broken_url, policy_info):
    """Smart URL replacement discovery"""
    
    strategies = [
        # Try common URL pattern variations
        lambda: try_url_variations(broken_url),
        
        # Search platform help centers
        lambda: search_help_center(policy_info.platform, policy_info.name),
        
        # Use Archive.org historical URLs
        lambda: find_archived_versions(broken_url),
        
        # Research competitor policy pages
        lambda: research_policy_pages(policy_info.platform, policy_info.keywords)
    ]
    
    for strategy in strategies:
        candidates = await strategy()
        if candidates:
            return await validate_candidates(candidates)
    
    return None
```

    assert classify_response(404) == URLHealthStatus.BROKEN
    assert classify_response(200) == URLHealthStatus.HEALTHY
    assert classify_response(500) == URLHealthStatus.MAINTENANCE

# Test retry logic  
def test_retry_logic():
    # Verify exponential backoff
    # Test max retry limits
    # Validate failure escalation
```
