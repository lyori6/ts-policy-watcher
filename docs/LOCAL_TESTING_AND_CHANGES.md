# Local Testing & Recent Changes

## Overview
The latest work focuses on two areas:
- **URL health checks** now fall back to a `GET` request when providers reject `HEAD` requests (e.g., `support.google.com`). This prevents false “failed” status reports in `url_health.json` and ensures we only report genuine outages.
- **Weekly summaries** now degrade gracefully when Gemini API keys are unavailable. The aggregator auto-selects a backup key when present and otherwise generates a deterministic fallback summary so reports never surface raw error strings.

These updates ensure Policy Watcher keeps collecting real policy content and continues producing business-facing weekly reports even if external dependencies glitch.

## Recommended Local QA Checklist
Run the following commands from the repository root with an activated virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`).

1. **Smoke test the fetcher**
   ```bash
   DEVELOPMENT_MODE=1 venv/bin/python scripts/fetch.py
   ```
   Expect “26 pages checked … 0 failures.” Spot-check any updated snapshot, e.g.:
   ```bash
   less snapshots/development/youtube-hiding-users/snapshot.html
   ```
   Verify the HTML contains real policy text rather than error stubs.

2. **Rebuild health data**
   ```bash
   venv/bin/python scripts/health_check.py
   ```
   Confirm affected URLs now record `http_status: 200`. A quick check for the YouTube harassment policy:
   ```bash
   jq '."https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268".health_history[0]' url_health.json
   ```

3. **Test weekly summary fallback**
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY= GEMINI_API_KEY_2= venv/bin/python scripts/weekly_aggregator.py --manual --week-ending 2025-08-21
   jq '.["2025-08-15_to_2025-08-21"].summary' weekly_summaries.json
   ```
   You should see well-formed fallback markdown instead of the previous error string.

4. **(Optional) Verify AI path**
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_key> venv/bin/python scripts/weekly_aggregator.py --manual
   ```
   With a key present, the summary should be written by Gemini, confirming the fallback triggers only when keys are absent or failing.

5. **Final review**
   ```bash
 git diff scripts/health_check.py scripts/weekly_aggregator.py
 git status -sb
  ```
  Ensure only the expected files are modified before committing or merging.

## Branch & Deployment Notes
- If you prefer to keep `main` always releasable, create a dev branch for these changes:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b fix/url-health-fallback
  ```
- After QA, commit and merge the branch (PR optional if you’re solo, but the branch keeps the history clean).
- When ready, rerun the fetcher and aggregator in production context (without `DEVELOPMENT_MODE` and with real API keys) so live artifacts reflect the fixes.

## Vercel Preview & Pre-Deployment Checklist
- Push your dev branch (e.g. `git push -u origin dev-url-health-fallback`) to let Vercel build a preview deployment.
- Once the preview URL is live, smoke-test the dashboard:
  - Confirm the policy list loads, health statuses are present, and the updated snapshots display correctly.
  - Check the weekly summary view to ensure fallback text or AI-generated content renders as expected.
- If everything looks right, complete any final commits (updated `run_log.json`, `url_health.json`, `weekly_summaries.json`) and push again so the preview reflects the latest artifacts.
- Deploy to `main` only after both the local CLI checks and the Vercel preview look good. Immediately rerun `venv/bin/python scripts/fetch.py` and `scripts/weekly_aggregator.py` without dev flags/post-merge to refresh production datasets.

Keep this checklist handy for future regressions; it captures everything needed to prove that Policy Watcher is back to collecting complete data and emitting summaries even when external services misbehave.
