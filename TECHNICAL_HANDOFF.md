## 1. System Architecture & Core Components

The T&S Policy Watcher is an automated intelligence pipeline designed to be robust and maintainable. It is orchestrated by a GitHub Actions workflow and composed of several key components.

### 1.1. High-Level Data Flow

```

```

### 1.2. Key Components & Technologies

*   **Orchestration (`.github/workflows/watch.yml`):**
    *   A GitHub Actions workflow triggers the pipeline on a 6-hour cron schedule.
    *   **NEW**: Includes integrated URL health monitoring with pre-flight checks.
    *   It is responsible for checking out the code, setting up the Python environment, installing dependencies, and executing the scripts.
    *   It manages all necessary environment variables (API keys, etc.) as GitHub secrets.
    *   **Enhanced Flow**: Health Check → Content Monitoring → Analysis → Notifications (combined policy changes + health alerts)

*   **Data Collection (`scripts/fetch.py`):**
    *   Reads the list of target URLs from `platform_urls.json`.
    *   Uses a dual-renderer approach: `httpx` for fast, simple requests, falling back to `playwright` (a headless browser) for JavaScript-heavy sites that block standard scrapers.
    *   Performs sophisticated HTML cleaning using `BeautifulSoup` to isolate core policy text and remove dynamic content (ads, scripts, nonces, etc.).
    *   Compares the cleaned content of the newly fetched page against the version stored in `snapshots/`. If a meaningful change is detected, it overwrites the snapshot.

*   **Analysis & Notification (`scripts/diff_and_notify.py`):**
    *   This script runs *after* `fetch.py`.
    *   It uses `git diff` to identify which snapshot files have been changed in the latest commit.
    *   For each changed policy, it sends the old and new content to the Google Gemini API to generate a summary of the changes.

    **CRITICAL DEPENDENCY:** This script relies on the `git` history created by the `watch.yml` workflow. The workflow runs `fetch.py`, then **commits** any changes to the `snapshots/` directory. `diff_and_notify.py` then uses `git diff` against the previous commit to find what changed. It cannot be run standalone without a preceding commit.
    *   **Enhanced**: Now loads and processes health alerts alongside policy changes.
    *   It aggregates all summaries and health alerts, sending a single, consolidated email notification via the Resend API.

*   **Health Monitoring (`scripts/health_check.py`):** **[NEW COMPONENT]**
    *   **Proactive URL Health Validation**: Performs lightweight HEAD requests to all policy URLs before content monitoring.
    *   **Health Status Classification**: URLs are classified as `healthy`, `degraded`, or `failed` based on HTTP status and response time.
    *   **Alert Detection**: Compares current health state with previous runs to detect newly failed URLs.
    *   **Non-blocking Design**: Health failures don't stop content monitoring - they're reported via alerts.
    *   **Health History Tracking**: Maintains 30 days of health check history per URL.
    *   **Data Outputs**: Generates `url_health.json` (status tracking) and `health_alerts.json` (alert notifications).
    *   **Integration**: Health data is committed to Git alongside snapshots and consumed by dashboard + notifications.

*   **Data Storage (JSON & Git):**
    *   **`platform_urls.json`:** The master configuration file defining which policies to track.
    *   **`snapshots/`:** A directory containing the raw HTML of the latest version of each policy. These files are committed to Git, creating a version history.
    *   **`summaries.json`:** The persistent database of AI-generated content, including an initial comprehensive summary and a summary of the latest update for each policy.
    *   **`run_log.json`:** A log of the most recent script run, capturing the timestamp, number of pages checked, changes found, and any errors. This file powers the dashboard's operational status.
    *   **`url_health.json`:** **[NEW]** Complete health tracking database with per-URL status, history, and system-wide metrics.
    *   **`health_alerts.json`:** **[NEW]** Recent health alerts for newly failed URLs, consumed by notification system.

*   **Frontend (`dashboard/`):**
    *   A static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript single-page application.
    *   **Enhanced**: Now fetches health data (`url_health.json`, `health_alerts.json`) alongside existing data files.
    *   **Health Alert Display**: Shows visual health alert banners when URLs are inaccessible.
    *   **Simplified Status**: Shows "Operational" vs detailed health metrics for external users.
    *   Hosted on Vercel, which automatically redeploys on pushes to the `main` branch.
    *   **Branch Detection**: Automatically loads data from correct branch (`main` for production, `dev` for preview deployments).

    **NOTE:** The dashboard is a pure "pull" application. It has no backend server. The JavaScript code makes direct, unauthenticated GET requests to the raw content URLs of data files in the public GitHub repository.

## 2. Health Monitoring System Architecture **[NEW]**

### 2.1. Health Monitoring Philosophy

The system follows a **"Never Miss a Change"** approach - URL health issues should never cause silent failures in policy monitoring. The health system is designed to be:

- **Non-blocking**: Content monitoring continues even if URLs fail health checks
- **Proactive**: Detects and alerts on URL accessibility issues before they impact monitoring
- **Integrated**: Health alerts are combined with policy change notifications in single emails
- **User-friendly**: Dashboard shows simple "Operational" status rather than complex health metrics

### 2.2. Health Check Workflow

```
Every 6 Hours:
1. 🏥 Health Check (scripts/health_check.py)
   ├── HEAD requests to all 20+ policy URLs
   ├── Classify: healthy/degraded/failed  
   ├── Compare with previous state → detect new failures
   └── Generate: url_health.json + health_alerts.json

2. 📋 Content Monitoring (scripts/fetch.py) 
   ├── Proceeds regardless of health issues
   └── Uses GET + Playwright for actual content

3. 🔍 Analysis & Notification (scripts/diff_and_notify.py)
   ├── Process policy changes (existing)
   ├── Load health alerts (new)
   └── Send combined email notification
```

### 2.3. Health Data Structures

**`url_health.json`** - Complete health tracking:
```json
{
  "urls": {
    "https://example.com/policy": {
      "slug": "platform-policy-name",
      "platform": "Platform",
      "current_status": "healthy|degraded|failed",
      "consecutive_failures": 0,
      "health_history": [/* last 30 checks */]
    }
  },
  "system_health": {
    "total_urls": 20,
    "healthy_urls": 18,
    "failed_urls": 2,
    "system_uptime": 90.0,
    "last_check": "2025-08-08T19:36:14Z"
  }
}
```

**`health_alerts.json`** - Recent failures for notifications:
```json
[
  {
    "type": "url_failure",
    "url": "https://example.com/policy",
    "slug": "platform-policy-name", 
    "platform": "Platform",
    "previous_status": "healthy",
    "current_status": "failed",
    "error_message": "HTTP 403: Forbidden",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-08T14:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

### 2.4. Health Status Classification

- **🟢 Healthy**: HTTP 200, response time < 2s, no recent failures
- **🟡 Degraded**: HTTP 200 but slow (>2s) OR intermittent failures  
- **🔴 Failed**: HTTP 4xx/5xx, timeouts, DNS errors, or 3+ consecutive failures

### 2.5. Dashboard Health Integration

- **Health Alert Banner**: Red banner appears when URLs are inaccessible
- **Operational Status**: Simple "Operational" vs "Issues Detected" (not complex metrics)
- **Auto-dismiss**: Health alerts auto-hide after 30 seconds unless manually dismissed
- **Real-time Updates**: Health data loads from GitHub raw URLs alongside other dashboard data

---

## 3. Setup & Local Development

### 3.1. Prerequisites

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lyori6/ts-policy-watcher.git
    cd ts-policy-watcher
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    ```sh
    playwright install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```sh
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
    export GEMINI_API_KEY_2="your_backup_gemini_key"
    export RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key"
    export RECIPIENT_EMAIL="your_email@domain.com"
    ```

### 3.2. Running the Pipeline Locally

*   **Health Check:** `python3 scripts/health_check.py` **[NEW]**
*   **Fetch Snapshots:** `python3 scripts/fetch.py`
*   **Generate Summaries & Notifications:** `python3 scripts/diff_and_notify.py` (Note: This requires that `fetch.py` has been run and the resulting changes have been committed to git).
*   **View the Dashboard:** Open `dashboard/index.html` in a web browser.

### 3.3. Managing Monitored Policies

The `platform_urls.json` file is the heart of the configuration. To add, remove, or modify a tracked policy, simply edit this file. Each entry requires:

*   `platform`: The display name of the company (e.g., "TikTok").
*   `policy_name`: The specific name of the policy.
*   `url`: The direct, raw URL to the policy page.
*   `slug`: A unique, file-system-friendly identifier.
*   `renderer`: Determines which fetching engine to use. Use `httpx` for simple HTML pages and `playwright` for pages that are heavily JavaScript-driven or are known to block scrapers.

After modifying this file, the system will automatically pick up the changes on the next scheduled run.

### 2.4. GitHub Actions Deployment

The system runs automatically via GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/watch.yml`):

**Schedule**: Every 6 hours (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)  
**Trigger**: Cron schedule `0 */6 * * *` or manual workflow dispatch

**Required GitHub Secrets**:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_primary_gemini_key
GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your_backup_gemini_key  
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=notification_email@domain.com
```

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Checkout repository and setup Python 3.11
2. Install dependencies and Playwright browsers
3. Run `scripts/fetch.py` to collect policy snapshots
4. Commit any changed snapshots to Git
5. Run `scripts/diff_and_notify.py` for AI analysis and email notifications
6. Commit generated summaries and run logs
7. Push all changes back to main branch

### 2.5. Debugging Tools

The `fetch.py` script includes a debug mode that can be activated with an environment variable. This is invaluable for troubleshooting issues with HTML cleaning or change detection.

```bash
DEBUG_FETCH=1 python3 scripts/fetch.py
```

When run, this will save the raw and cleaned HTML content for comparison to the `/tmp/` directory, allowing you to run a `diff` and see exactly what the script is "seeing."

### 2.6. Dashboard Deployment

The dashboard is a static web application that can be deployed to any static hosting service:

**Current Deployment**: Vercel (automatically deploys from `main` branch)  
**Local Testing**: Open `dashboard/index.html` in any web browser  
**Data Source**: Dashboard fetches `run_log.json` and `summaries.json` directly from GitHub repository

**Dashboard Features**:
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Policy matrix with platform organization
- Historical trend analysis
- Individual policy detail views

## 3. Chronicle of Technical Issues & Resolutions

This section preserves the history of major technical challenges encountered during development. Understanding these challenges is key to maintaining and extending the system.

### 3.1. The False Positive Nightmare (Resolved)

*   **Problem:** The system was persistently detecting changes on Google/YouTube policy pages even when the content appeared unchanged. This was caused by dynamic content injected by the server on every page load.
*   **Investigation Chronicle:**
    1.  **Initial Suspect: Timestamps.** Early versions used timestamped filenames, which was quickly fixed by moving to stable filenames.
    2.  **Second Suspect: Dynamic HTML.** We implemented a `clean_html` function to strip `<script>`, `<style>`, and other non-content tags.
    3.  **Third Suspect: Feedback Forms.** The cleaning was made more surgical to remove specific dynamic `div`s like feedback forms.
    4.  **Final Root Cause:** A raw `diff` of the HTML revealed the true culprits: dynamically generated `nonce` attributes in script tags, random IDs on buttons, and hidden session IDs (`zwieback_id`).
*   **Resolution:** The `clean_html` function in `fetch.py` was significantly enhanced to:
    *   Correctly identify the main article body (`itemprop="articleBody"`).
    *   Use regular expressions to remove elements with dynamic ID patterns.
    *   Explicitly remove known dynamic containers like `div.subscribe-btn` and `div[data-page-data-key="zwieback_id"]`.
*   **Status:** This fix was successful and is now stable. The system reliably ignores cosmetic and dynamic changes.

### 3.2. The GitHub Actions Silent Crash (Resolved)

*   **Problem:** The `diff_and_notify.py` script was failing silently when run in the GitHub Actions environment. It would crash before writing any logs, making it impossible to debug from the script's output alone.
*   **Investigation Chronicle:**
    1.  Initial attempts to add more `try...except` blocks in the Python code failed to catch the error.
    2.  The breakthrough came from shifting focus to debugging the **runner environment itself**.
*   **Resolution:** A combination of environment-level and script-level logging was used to diagnose the issue.
    1.  **Workflow Debugging:** We added `set -x`, `pwd`, `ls -laR`, and `which python` directly to the `watch.yml` file to get a ground-truth view of the runner's state.
    2.  **Minimal Test Script:** A tiny test script that only accessed environment variables and wrote to a file was created. When it succeeded, it proved the fundamental environment was sound.
    3.  **Verbose Logging:** The main script was instrumented with print statements at every step, which finally revealed the point of failure.
*   **Status:** The underlying environmental issue was resolved, and the pipeline now runs reliably in GitHub Actions.

### 3.3. The Corrupted `fetch.py` and Logging Failure (Resolved)

*   **Problem:** The dashboard's system health log was showing "0 pages checked" because the `run_log.json` file was not being written correctly. The investigation was hampered by a faulty `view_file` tool that made `fetch.py` appear empty.
*   **Investigation Chronicle:**
    1.  The initial assumption was that the `fetch.py` file was corrupted locally.
    2.  After restoring the file from git, the issue persisted. The `run_log.json` was being created but was empty or incomplete.
    3.  The root cause was identified as a failing URL in `platform_urls.json` (`whatnot.com`) that was causing the script to time out and be killed before the final logging steps could execute.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  The dead URL was removed from the configuration.
    2.  The main processing loop in `fetch.py` was wrapped in a `try...finally` block to **guarantee** that the run statistics are written to `run_log.json`, even if an unhandled exception occurs during the fetch process.
*   **Status:** The system is now more resilient to network failures and correctly logs its run status.

---

## 4. Current Known Issues & Actionable Next Steps

*   **Refine Change Detection Accuracy:** The highest priority is to continue improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Actionable steps include:
    *   **Analyze Dynamic Class Names:** Some sites may use dynamic CSS class names that change on each load. Enhance the `clean_html` function to strip class attributes or normalize them.
    *   **Investigate JS-Rendered Timestamps:** Look for human-readable timestamps (e.g., "Last updated June 2024") that are rendered by JavaScript and may cause false positives.
    *   **Implement a Text-Based Diff:** As a final check, consider adding a comparison of the extracted plain text *in addition* to the cleaned HTML to be absolutely certain the core content has changed.
*   **Error Handling:** The current error handling logs failures. A future enhancement is to use this log to automatically create de-duplicated GitHub Issues for persistent failures, creating a more robust, trackable alerting system.

## 5. Recent System Fixes & Improvements (August 2025)

### 5.1. Critical Issues Resolved

**PRIMARY ISSUE: Missing Run Log Data**
- **Problem**: The `run_log.json` file wasn't being created by `scripts/fetch.py`, causing dashboard to show `0 pages checked`
- **Root Cause**: Run log functionality was removed from fetch.py but still expected by GitHub workflow
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive run statistics tracking to `scripts/fetch.py:122-125` and log creation logic at `scripts/fetch.py:215-244`
- **Result**: System now properly logs all operations (e.g., "20 pages checked, 1 changes found")

**CRITICAL: Email Content Truncation Issue**
- **Problem**: Email notifications were truncated after "Based on the diff, the competitor has made the following key changes:" with no actual content
- **Root Cause**: `create_concise_summary()` function was filtering out bullet points (`*` and `-`) and limiting content to 200 characters
- **Fix**: Updated function at `scripts/diff_and_notify.py:217-250` to preserve markdown formatting and increased length limit to 800 characters
- **Result**: Full policy change details now appear in email notifications

**Duplicate Run Log Management**
- **Problem**: Both `fetch.py` and `diff_and_notify.py` were trying to manage run_log.json, causing conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate logging from `diff_and_notify.py`, consolidated in `fetch.py`
- **Result**: Clean, single-source run logging

**Deprecated DateTime Usage**
- **Problem**: Multiple `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings throughout codebase
- **Fix**: Updated to `datetime.now(UTC)` in both `scripts/fetch.py:122` and `scripts/diff_and_notify.py:192`
- **Result**: No more deprecation warnings

### 5.2. Local Development Infrastructure

**Environment Configuration**
- **Added**: `.env.local` file for local testing with API keys
- **Added**: `load_env.sh` script for easy environment setup using: `source load_env.sh`
- **Security**: Added `.env.local` to `.gitignore` to prevent secret leaks
- **Usage**: 
  ```bash
  # Set up your API keys in .env.local, then:
  export $(cat .env.local | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$' | xargs)
  python3 scripts/fetch.py
  COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) python3 scripts/diff_and_notify.py
  ```

**Email Testing & Configuration**
- **Issue**: Resend API restrictions required specific verified email address
- **Fix**: Updated configuration to use verified email address
- **Verification**: Successfully tested full email pipeline with professional HTML formatting

### 5.3. Code Quality & Performance

**Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added detailed debugging output for email functionality
- Improved exception handling in API calls with specific error context

- **Data Persistence**: Verified proper updates to `summaries.json` and `run_log.json`

**Email Content Quality Example:**
The system now correctly generates and sends detailed policy summaries like:
> "Here are the key changes based on the diff:
> * **Elimination of a User Feedback Form:** A detailed feedback mechanism, including options for reporting issues like 'inaccurate,' 'hard to understand,' or 'missing info,' has been entirely removed.
> * **Removal of User Submission Capability:** Users can no longer provide additional information or 'other suggestions' via this specific interface."

```
"here's a concise summary of the"
"as a trust & safety analyst, here"
"as a trust & safety analyst, here's"  
"summary for product manager"
"summary for a product manager"
"concise summary for a product manager"
"concise summary for the product manager"
"for a product manager:"
"for the product manager:"
"overview:"
"key information:"
"policy overview:"
```

**Multi-Layer Filtering Logic:**
1. **Contains Check**: Pattern anywhere in line
2. **Starts-With Check**: Line begins with pattern (first 50 chars)
3. **Header Colon Check**: Headers ending with colons that match patterns
4. **Markdown Header Check**: `###` or `##` headers containing patterns

## 9. Agent Onboarding Guide for Future Development

### 9.1. Quick Start for AI Agents

**Context Understanding:**
This is a production Trust & Safety policy monitoring system that:
- Monitors 20 policy pages across TikTok, YouTube, Meta, and Whatnot
- Uses AI (Google Gemini) to generate policy change summaries
- Sends professional plain text email notifications via Resend API
- Runs on 6-hour GitHub Actions cron schedule
- Maintains Git-based change history and JSON data persistence

**System Health Check:**
```bash
# Verify system status
cat run_log.json | jq '.[0]'  # Latest run statistics
cat summaries.json | jq 'keys[]' | wc -l  # Count monitored policies
```

**Local Development Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Environment setup
source load_env.sh  # Loads API keys from .env.local

# 2. Test fetch process
DEBUG_FETCH=1 python3 scripts/fetch.py

# 3. Test notification system (requires git commit)
COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) python3 scripts/diff_and_notify.py
```

### 9.2. Common Development Tasks

**Adding New Policy to Monitor:**
1. Edit `platform_urls.json` with new entry:
   ```json
   {
     "platform": "PlatformName",
     "name": "Policy Title", 
     "slug": "platform-policy-slug",
     "url": "https://direct-policy-url.com",
     "renderer": "httpx|playwright"
   }
   ```
2. Run `python3 scripts/fetch.py` to create initial snapshot
3. System will automatically detect and process future changes

**Debugging Change Detection Issues:**
```bash
# Enable debug mode to compare raw vs cleaned HTML
DEBUG_FETCH=1 python3 scripts/fetch.py

# Check generated files in /tmp/
ls -la /tmp/fetch_debug_*

# Compare raw and cleaned content
diff /tmp/fetch_debug_raw_[slug].html /tmp/fetch_debug_cleaned_[slug].html
```

**Testing Email System:**
```bash
# Set up test environment
export RECIPIENT_EMAIL="your-test@email.com"

# Create test change by modifying any snapshot file
echo "<!-- test change -->" >> snapshots/any-policy/snapshot.html
git add . && git commit -m "TEST: Manual change for email testing"

# Trigger notification
COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) python3 scripts/diff_and_notify.py
```

### 9.3. Architecture Knowledge for Agents

**Critical Dependencies:**
- `diff_and_notify.py` requires a Git commit before running (it uses `git diff` to find changes)
- Dashboard reads `run_log.json` and `summaries.json` directly from GitHub repo
- Email formatting uses plain text (no HTML) for mobile compatibility
- AI summaries are cached in `summaries.json` to avoid re-processing

**File Relationships:**
```
platform_urls.json → scripts/fetch.py → snapshots/ → git commit
                                           ↓
dashboard/ ← run_log.json + summaries.json ← scripts/diff_and_notify.py
                                           ↓
                                    Email Notification
```

**Known Gotchas:**
1. **HTML Cleaning**: The `clean_html()` function is critical - improper cleaning causes false positives
2. **Renderer Choice**: Use `playwright` for JavaScript-heavy sites, `httpx` for simple HTML
3. **API Key Rotation**: System supports backup Gemini API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY_2`)
4. **Email Limits**: Resend API requires verified sender email address

### 9.4. Troubleshooting Guide for Agents

**"Dashboard shows 0 pages checked":**
- Check if `run_log.json` exists and has valid JSON
- Verify `scripts/fetch.py` completed successfully without exceptions
- Look for errors in GitHub Actions logs

**"No email notifications sent":**
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` environment variables
- Check if `git diff` shows actual changes (diff_and_notify requires git commits)
- Look for API errors in script output

**"False positive change detections":**
- Run `DEBUG_FETCH=1 python3 scripts/fetch.py` to examine cleaned HTML
- Look for dynamic content that needs additional filtering in `clean_html()`
- Check for timestamp or session ID patterns that change on each page load

**"AI summaries are poor quality":**
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid and has quota
- Check the PROMPT_TEMPLATE in `scripts/diff_and_notify.py:23-28`
- Ensure diff content is meaningful (not just HTML formatting changes)

### 9.5. Extension Points for Future Development

**High-Value Enhancements:**
1. **Slack Integration**: Add Slack webhook notification option alongside email
2. **Policy Categories**: Add tagging system for different policy types (content, commerce, etc.)
3. **Trend Analysis**: Build dashboard charts showing policy change frequency over time
4. **Webhook Support**: Add REST API endpoints for external integrations

**Technical Improvements:**
1. **Change Confidence Scoring**: Add AI-based relevance scoring for detected changes
2. **Multi-LLM Support**: Add fallback to other AI providers (Claude, OpenAI)
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Machine learning-based signal vs noise detection
4. **Snapshot Diff Views**: Web interface for viewing HTML diffs visually

### 9.6. Essential Context for Maintenance

**System Philosophy:**
- **Quality over Quantity**: Better to miss minor changes than send false positive alerts  
- **Mobile-First**: All outputs optimized for mobile email consumption
- **AI-Augmented**: Human-readable summaries more valuable than raw diffs
- **Git-Native**: Version control as the source of truth for all changes

**Business Impact:**
- Primary users are product managers and trust & safety teams
- Email summaries should be executive-ready and actionable
- System tracks competitor policy changes for strategic intelligence
- Zero tolerance for spam or noise in notifications

**Technical Constraints:**
- GitHub Actions 6-hour execution limit requires efficient processing
- Resend API free tier limits email volume  
- Gemini API quotas require intelligent usage and fallback planning
- Git repository size grows with every snapshot update

This guide provides comprehensive context for any AI agent to quickly understand, maintain, and extend the T&S Policy Watcher system effectively.
