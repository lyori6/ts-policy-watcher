### T&S Policy Watcher: V1.2 Planning & Refinement

#### 1. Core Objective

To refine the dashboard by transforming the high-level metrics into a sophisticated and actionable "Strategic Insights" panel. This involves enhancing the underlying analysis, improving the user experience, and ensuring all features are directly valuable for product management.

#### 2. Key Initiatives

##### **Initiative 1: Dashboard UX Refinement**

| Task | Description | Next Steps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1. Redesign System Uptime** | Replace the large "System Uptime" panel with a compact, space-efficient "System Status" indicator in the header. | **Action:** Modify `index.html` and `style.css` to create a header badge. The badge will show the latest run status (e.g., ✅ or ⚠️) and timestamp. Clicking it will expand to show the detailed run log. |

##### **Initiative 2: Enhance Strategic Insights**

This initiative will replace the v1 "Competitive Intelligence Panel" with a more advanced, data-driven implementation.

| Task | Description | Next Steps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1. Enhance Trend Alerts** | Move beyond simple counts to analyze the *velocity* and *focus* of policy changes. | **Action:** Update `script.js` to compare recent change frequency against historical averages and identify recurring themes in updates (e.g., multiple updates to the same policy). |
| **2.2. Implement Feature Landscape** | Reframe "Gap Analysis" to analyze the policy landscape of competitors, requiring no internal data. | **Action:** Add logic to `script.js` to categorize policies by theme (e.g., "Live Shopping," "User Blocking") and highlight which platforms have detailed policies in those areas. |
| **2.3. Implement Emerging Themes** | Use AI to perform thematic analysis across all recent policy changes to identify macro trends. | **Action:** This is a future goal. It will likely require a new script that periodically runs an AI model over `summaries.json` to extract and store key themes. |
