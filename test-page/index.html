    <h1>Internal Test Policy - Version 1.0</h1>

    <h2>Section 2: The First Update</h2>
    <p>This new section is being added to test the change detection and AI summary generation pipeline. The system should detect this addition, classify it as a change, and generate a new summary for it.</p>
    <p>We can modify this file to trigger the change detection and notification workflow.</p>
