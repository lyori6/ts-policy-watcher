Exclusions to Whatnot Buyer Protection Policy
While our Buyer Protection Policy protects buyers when unexpected events impact their purchase, there are some circumstances where we do not provide a refund, even if the refund claim may fall under the issues listed above.
Consumable Products: Because the value of consumable products changes once the product is consumed or opened, we may not provide refunds on consumable products, including:
Breaks: Any item(s) purchased in a break are only eligible for a refund if an item is missing, delayed, incorrect, or damaged. See
High Value Loss Reimbursement Policy
for more on missing high value cards.
Other consumable products: Any other product that is consumed or opened by the buyer in a manner that changes the item’s value is ineligible for a refund, unless an item is spoiled, expired, missing, delayed, incorrect, or damaged.
Tips: As set out in our
Tip Terms and Conditions
, tips to sellers are ineligible for refunds.
Refusing Delivery: Refusing delivery of your purchase does not qualify your order for a refund.
Failing to Pickup: Failing to collect packages that are held for pickup by local couriers does not qualify the order for a refund.
Customs Fees: Refusal to pay applicable customs or duties due does not qualify the order for a refund. Additionally, any customs fees or duties paid are not eligible for a refund. If you paid import duties or taxes as part of clearing your package through customs but you then returned the item, please contact your customs authority regarding a refund of the charges.
Exchange Rate: Whatnot will not reimburse users for any losses related to exchange rate fluctuations or currency conversions.
Chargebacks: Orders that have been disputed with your financial institution are ineligible for refunds.
Digital Content: Pattern PDFs, and other Digital Content are ineligible for refunds.
Potential fraud abuse of policy: Buyers that exhibit indications of refund and/or return fraud, abuse of policy, or otherwise violate Whatnot policies may be refused refunds or have action taken against their account. Any determination of potential abuse or fraud is at the full discretion of Whatnot.
Incorrect item returned: You will not be eligible for a refund if you return an incorrect item (and the item will not be returned to you by Whatnot). When packing your return, please carefully check that you are returning the correct item. You will not be compensated for any incorrect items sent to Whatnot.
Off-platform transactions: Any transactions that occur off Whatnot are not eligible for a refund.

EU/UK Right of Withdrawal
If you are a consumer living in the EU or the UK and you have bought a product through Whatnot from a professional seller, you may have a statutory right to cancel your purchase, without giving any reason, within 14 days from the date on which you received the item(s). If you cancel within this time frame, and also return the item(s) within 14 days of cancellation, you may be entitled to a refund for that purchase.
If you are exercising this right, please be aware of the following:
You will not receive a refund unless you return the item(s) within 14 days of your cancellation.
You are responsible for paying the cost associated with returning the item(s).
You must have taken possession of the item(s) in order to request a refund in this way – you cannot have refused delivery or decided not to pay customs fees.
The statutory right does not apply to purchases made related to
Breaks
or
Surprise Products
.
Additionally, the statutory right does not apply to requests related to: products not suitable for return for health or hygienic reasons (if you unsealed them); goods that are inseparably mixed with other items; sealed audio or video recordings and sealed software (if you unsealed them); products which are made to your specifications or are customized; and products which can deteriorate or expire rapidly.
The amount of your refund may be reduced based on the diminished value of the goods since your purchase.
Your request may be rejected if we determine you are acting in bad faith or otherwise violating Whatnot’s
Terms of Service
and/or
Community Guidelines
.
