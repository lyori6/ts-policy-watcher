Once you submit the appeal, the Oversight Board will decide whether or not to review it. The board only selects a certain number of eligible appeals to review, so they may not choose yours.
At any point following the submission of your appeal, you’ll be able to check the appeal status by logging on to the Oversight Board’s website using your reference number. Keep in mind that you have 15 days from when the decision was made to appeal to the Oversight Board. After 15 days, the window to appeal a decision has expired and you'll no longer be able to submit it.
