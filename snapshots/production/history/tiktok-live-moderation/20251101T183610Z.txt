How moderating works on TikTok LIVE
As a creator or moderator on TikTok LIVE, you can block certain messages, and report, mute, limit, or block viewers who violate our
Community Guidelines
or send unwanted messages
in the LIVE chat. Creators can also add people as moderators to assist with managing viewers during the LIVE.
A few things to know:
• Only creators who meet the
eligibility requirements
can go LIVE on TikTok.
• Moderators need to be granted permission by the creator.
• To go LIVE on a web browser, you must download
LIVE Studio
(Windows) or
OBS Studio
(Linux, macOS, or Windows). LIVE moderators don't require access to LIVE Studio or OBS Studio when moderating on a web browser.
