Blocking someone
Blocking someone on TikTok means you can't view each other's posts, find each other's profiles in search, or exchange direct messages. You may still see them in multi-host LIVE, Duets posted by others, or shared group chats. People you've blocked won't be notified when you block them, and any prior connection with them will be removed. If you believe someone on TikTok violates our
Community Guidelines
, please
report it to us
.
To block someone:
1. In the TikTok app, go to the person's profile.
2. Tap the
Share
button at the top.
3. Tap
Block
at the bottom, then tap
Block
again to confirm.
To block multiple people:
1. In the TikTok app, go to one of your posts.
2. Tap the
Comments
button.
3. Press and hold the comment, then select
Manage multiple comments

Filters
button at the top.
4. Select the comments from accounts you want to block, then tap
More

5. Tap
Block accounts
