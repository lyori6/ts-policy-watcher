Before you can appeal Instagram's content decision to the Oversight Board, you must first
request a review of your content
or
the content you reported
. If we’ve reviewed your content or the content you reported twice and you still disagree with our decision, you may be eligible to appeal that decision to the Oversight Board. Keep in mind that not all content and content decisions will be eligible for appeal, but we’re adding more options.
Appeal a decision Instagram made about your content:
Appeal a decision Instagram made about content you reported:
Once you submit the appeal, the Oversight Board will decide whether or not to review it. The board only selects a certain number of eligible appeals to review, so they may not choose yours.
At any point following the submission of your appeal, you’ll be able to check the appeal status by logging on to the Oversight Board’s website using your reference number. Keep in mind that you have 15 days from when the decision was made to appeal to the Oversight Board. After 15 days, the window to appeal a decision has expired and you'll no longer be able to submit it.
