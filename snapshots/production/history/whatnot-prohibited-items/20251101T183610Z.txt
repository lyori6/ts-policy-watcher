While we encourage Whatnot sellers to offer a diversity of items on the platform, there are some items that Whatnot does not support at this time, or that require additional restrictions to sell on Whatnot.
Our decision to prohibit or restrict certain items is based on varied reasons – some items pose legal or safety risk to the Whatnot community, some items negatively impact other users’ experience, and some items aren’t well-suited for the Whatnot platform at this time.
As always, sellers must ensure that any item they are offering for sale (or giving away) is permitted by, and complies with, all applicable laws in their jurisdiction, and in the jurisdictions of their buyers. In addition, sellers must ensure they comply with applicable shipping terms and requirements in their jurisdiction, for example, sellers in the United States using USPS must comply with all
USPS shipping requirements
