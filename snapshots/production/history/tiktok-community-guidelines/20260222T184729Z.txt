Community Guidelines
Overview
Released August 14, 2025
Effective September 13, 2025
TikTok is where people discover things they love, build communities, and express themselves. Our mission is simple: we want to inspire creativity and bring joy.
We have Community Guidelines to help keep TikTok a safe and positive experience. These rules apply to everyone and everything on our platform.
You're in the right place if you're wondering:
What’s allowed on TikTok
What’s not allowed on TikTok
What’s not allowed in the For You feed (FYF)
We’ve organized our Community Guidelines by topic to make information easier to find. Under each category, you’ll find a “More information” section. That’s where we define key terms, answer common questions, and share helpful examples. These examples are meant to guide you, but they don't cover every situation.
If you're ever unsure about what to post, just remember to be kind and treat others the way you would want to be treated.
Thanks for helping to keep TikTok a welcoming space for everyone!
Our Rules
We strive for Community Guidelines that are easy to understand. We’ve created a quick summary of what we don’t allow across each of the major topics covered in our Community Guidelines. If you're looking for more details, they can be found after this section.
Safety and Civility
Violent and Criminal Behavior:
We don’t allow threats, encouragement or glorification of violence, promotion of crime, or instructions on how to commit harmful acts.
Hate Speech and Hateful Behavior:
We don’t allow content that promotes hate or attacks people based on protected attributes like race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.
Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals:
We don’t allow people or groups that promote violence or hate, including violent extremists, criminal organizations, or those responsible for mass violence. Supporting, recruiting for, or promoting these entities is also prohibited.
Youth Sexual and Physical Abuse:
We don't allow content that shows, promotes, or facilitates the sexual abuse, exploitation, or harm of young people.
Adult Sexual Abuse:
We don’t allow content that shows, promotes, or facilitates adult sexual abuse or exploitation.
Human Trafficking and Smuggling:
We don’t allow content that promotes or facilitates human trafficking or smuggling.
Harassment and Bullying:
We don’t allow content that harasses or bullies others, including degrading remarks about appearance, doxing, sexual harassment, or coordinated abuse. We allow commentary about political figures which may be critical, but remove content that crosses into severe harm.
Mental and Behavioral Health
Suicide and Self-Harm:
We don’t allow content that shows, promotes, or provides instructions for suicide or self-harm.
Disordered Eating, Risky Weight Management, and Body Image:
We don’t allow content that promotes disordered eating, risky weight loss or muscle gain methods, or harmful body comparisons.
Dangerous Activity and Challenges:
We don’t allow content that shows or promotes dangerous stunts, dares, or challenges that could lead to physical harm.
Sensitive and Mature Themes
Body Exposure and Sexualized Behaviors
: We don’t allow some types of body exposure or sexual behavior, including nudity, sexual activity, sexual services, or any sexually suggestive behavior or significant exposure involving young people.
Shocking and Graphic Content:
We don’t allow extremely graphic, violent, or disturbing content—especially when it could cause viewers emotional distress.
Animal Abuse:

Integrity and Authenticity
Misinformation:
We don’t allow misinformation that could cause significant harm to individuals or society.
Civic and Election Integrity:
We don’t allow content that could mislead voters or interfere with elections, including false claims about how to vote, who can vote, or the outcome of an election.
Edited Media and AI-Generated Content (AIGC):
We require clear labeling when AI or editing is used to realistically depict people or scenes. We don’t allow AIGC that misleads about matters of public importance or that harms individuals.
Unoriginal Content and Intellectual Property Rights:
We don’t allow content that violates intellectual property rights, including reposts of copyrighted or trademarked material without permission.
Deceptive Behavior & Fake Engagement:
We don’t allow accounts that mislead or try to manipulate our platform, or the trade of services that artificially boost engagement or trick the recommendation system.
Regulated Goods, Services, and Commercial Activities
Regulated Goods, Services, and Commercial Activities:
We don’t allow the trade, marketing, or promotion of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services. Registered business accounts and verified TikTok Shop sellers may be allowed to sell or market some regulated items if they meet strict requirements.
Commercial Disclosure and Paid Marketing:
If you're promoting a product, brand, or business, you must use TikTok’s content disclosure setting.
Frauds and Scams:
We don’t allow content that promotes or facilitates scams, fraud, or deceptive schemes.
Privacy and Security

We don’t allow sharing personal information that could lead to harm, such as identity theft, stalking, or fraud.
Platform Security:
We don’t allow attempts to hack, reverse-engineer, or otherwise compromise TikTok’s systems.

Content Moderation
We want TikTok to be a safe, fun, and creative place for everyone. Here’s how we support that goal:
We Remove Content
We Age-Restrict Content
Some content may not be appropriate for people under 18. When we identify content that falls under the “Age-Restricted” standards in our Community Guidelines, we make it viewable only for adults.
For You Feed Standards
The For You Feed is designed to help you discover a variety of content and creators, and for creators to reach new audiences and build thriving communities. However, not all content is guaranteed to be recommended. When we identify content that falls under the “FYF Ineligible” standards in our Community Guidelines, it won't be recommended in the FYF.

We give you tools and resources to stay informed and in control
You are empowered to manage your experience on TikTok. We provide a
safety toolkit
that helps you customize your content preferences and
account settings
, and manage interactions. In addition, for some content, you'll see opt-in screens or banners to give you more context about a post.
You can also visit our
Safety Center
resources for extra support.
