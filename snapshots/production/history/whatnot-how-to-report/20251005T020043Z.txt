Gather and review evidence to determine whether our
Community Guidelines

in line with our policies
During an investigation, we may temporarily restrict a user. For example, we might suspend their ability to go live.
To keep Whatnot safe and fun, we also proactively investigate suspicious behavior and other reports from the community. We regularly evaluate seller and buyer issues to understand patterns and habitual abuse of our policies. If we detect a pattern with evidence, we’ll take action.

You can check whether our team has reviewed your report, and see your report history, directly on Whatnot.
For privacy reasons, we don’t share the specific outcome of individual investigations.
