Blocking people on Whatnot prevents them from interacting with you.
When you block someone they can no longer:
Follow you
Search for or browse your profile
Send you direct messages (DMs)
Join, chat, or bookmark your shows
Make future purchases from you (any orders placed before blocking will still be honored)
After you block someone:
They won't be notified
If they revisit your profile from an old DM or past purchase, they’ll see they’ve been blocked
You can unblock them at any time
If someone is breaking our
Community Guidelines
, you can also
report them
to our Trust & Safety team.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
Can I see a list of people I’ve blocked?
No. At the moment, it's not possible to view a list of everyone you’ve blocked on Whatnot.
What’s the difference between being removed from a show and blocked?
Removed from a show:
Only sellers and moderators can
remove someone from a show
. If you’re removed, you won’t be able to rejoin that specific show.
Blocked:
Anyone on Whatnot can block someone else to prevent future interaction. If a seller blocks you, you won’t be able to join their shows, chat, or buy from them again. When you visit their profile, you’ll see a message confirming that they’ve blocked you.
