"""
Phase 2.2: Enhanced Core Health Checking Service

Proactive URL health monitoring to detect issues before they impact policy monitoring.
- Quick HEAD requests for fast health validation (httpx URLs)
- ENHANCED: Real Playwright health checks for bot-protected URLs
- Health status tracking and history
- Integration with existing fetch.py system
- Separate from content fetching for efficiency

Design Goals:
- Fast health checks (<30s for all URLs)
- Minimal bandwidth usage (HEAD requests for httpx URLs)
- ENHANCED: Smart bot protection handling (Playwright health checks for real validation)
- Robust error classification
- Historical health tracking

Recent Enhancements:
- Playwright integration for bot-protected sites (WhatNot, TikTok, Meta)
- Real HTTP status validation instead of assumption-based health reporting
- Configurable Playwright health check behavior
- Improved error detection and classification
